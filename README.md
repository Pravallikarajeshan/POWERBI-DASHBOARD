# POWERBI-DASHBOARD
This repository contains an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for analyzing and visualizing heart disease prediction data. The dashboard provides insights into factors affecting heart disease, including Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Levels, Chest Pain Types, and more.  

It is designed to help users:
- Understand trends and relationships in the data.
- Use KPIs to summarize patient statistics.
- Analyze metrics through interactive visuals and filters.
  ## ⚙️ Key Features
- **KPI Cards**:  
  - Total Patients  
  - Percentage of Patients with Heart Disease  
  - Average Age of Patients  
  - Count of Patients with High Cholesterol  

- **Visualizations**:
  - Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for metrics like Chest Pain Types, Resting BP, Fasting BP, and Cholesterol Levels.  
  - Scatter plots to analyze correlations between variables like `Age`, `MaxHR`, and `Oldpeak`.  

- **Filters**:  
  - Gender, Chest Pain Type, Age Range, and Heart Disease Status filters for deeper insights.  
## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset used for this dashboard includes the following columns:  
- `Age`: Age of the patient.  
- `Sex`: Gender of the patient (Male/Female).  
- `ChestPainType`: Type of chest pain experienced.  
- `RestingBP`: Resting blood pressure in mmHg.  
- `Cholesterol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dL.  
- `FastingBS`: Fasting blood sugar (1 if >120 mg/dL, 0 otherwise).  
- `RestingECG`: Resting electrocardiographic results.  
- `MaxHR`: Maximum heart rate achieved.  
- `ExerciseAngina`: Exercise-induced angina (Yes/No).  
- `Oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.  
- `ST_Slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.  
- `HeartDisease`: Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease).
